# Hi 👋 I’m Varun 

I’m a master’s graduate in Business Analytics from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.

Before I decided to take the plunge and become a full time student, I worked as a product marketer for 4 years at [Freshworks](https://freshworks.com/), the first SaaS company from India to go public on NASDAQ.  Most recently I interned at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), a global leader in cybersecurity.

By education, I’m an engineer. By profession, a product marketer. But at my core, I’m a generalist who loves tinkering. I love wearing multiple hats and take pride in my ability to analyze, design, code and sell. 

Check out my [product experiments here](/projects.html). 

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/). 🤝
