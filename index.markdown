<h1 id="hello-i-m-varun-">Hello I&#39;m Varun! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I am currently pursuing a master&#39;s degree in Business Analytics from W.P.Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. </p>
<p>Before I decided to take the plunge and become a full time student, I worked as a product marketer for 4 years at Freshworks, the first SaaS company from India to go public on NASDAQ. </p>
<p>I&#39;m also an avid volunteer, education is a cause that is close to my heart and I have volunteered with several NGOs in India, teaching children English and Math. </p>
<p>In my downtime you can find me exercising, catching up on the latest trends in tech or being sucked into YouTube&#39;s algorithmic blackhole! </p>
