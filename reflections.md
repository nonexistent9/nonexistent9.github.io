**Talk to People**

Connect with friends. Talk to people. Many times I’m just lost in my own world. Disconnected. Isolated. Only after I talk to someone, its like I’m woken up from my slumber. The fog starts lifting away and I can see things more clearly. I just need to get over the initial inertia of putting the effort.

**Emotional Runway**

Last week I hit a pretty big slump productivity wise. Felt burnt out, anxious, paralyzed however you may want to call it. I had to slow down, take a day off. I was trying to do everything at once, solve all of my problems in one go and trying to boil the ocean. I failed to realize that its a process. I have to remain patient. Put in work consistently and let the chips fall where they may. The way I was trying to do things was not sustainable. I've to realize its okay to take your time to do stuff, as they say Rome was not built in a day. For my own sanity, I need to slow down and breathe.
