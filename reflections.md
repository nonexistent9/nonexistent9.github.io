**Talk to People**

Connect with friends. Talk to people. Many times I’m just lost in my own world. Disconnected. Isolated. Only after I talk to someone, its like I’m woken up from my slumber. The fog starts lifting away and I can see things more clearly. I just need to get over the initial inertia of putting the effort.

**Emotional Runway**

Last week I hit a pretty big slump productivity wise. Felt burnt out, anxious, paralyzed however you may want to call it. I had to slow down, take a day off. I was trying to do everything at once, solve all of my problems in one go and trying to boil the ocean. I failed to realize that its a process. I have to remain patient. Put in work consistently and let the chips fall where they may. The way I was trying to do things was not sustainable. I've to realize its okay to take your time to do stuff, as they say Rome was not built in a day. For my own sanity, I need to slow down and breathe.     


**You're not Special**

In my startup journey so far, I've learnt one major thing — I'm not special. Not even close. 
I have been rejected from many accelerators and founder fellowship type applications and when I look at some of the successful applicants or founders on social media, I realize I don't really fit in. In many of these applications they keep asking this one particular question of what makes you special or what's the most impressive thing that you have done. And then I realize that I haven't really done anything that's spectacular. I have a moderately successful career, you could say, but it's nothing special. 

Before you start up, you are under sort of an illusion. But when you are out in the free world trying to make stuff happen for your own company, the reality hits you much harder, at least in a big organization, you can be insulated from the damage and you can sort of cover your own incompetence. However, you're not able to do that in your own startup when you're the face of the company and you're evaluated solely on your capabilities. You come to realize that you're not special. 

After a while, when you have made peace with this fact, you work with what you have. You realize this is not a reason to give up because much smarter people you probably went to school with are working in big corporations and not really starting up. So there's clearly something beyond plain intelligence that's required for starting up. So you cope and carry on.
