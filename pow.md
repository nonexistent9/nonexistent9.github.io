**Freshchat building battlecards from scratch**

**Problem**   
We were gearing up to re-launch [Freshchat](https://www.freshworks.com/live-chat-software/). I had just joined the Freshchat product marketing team.

**Customer Case Studies**

- Worked with the support team to reach out to customers who were satisfied with product and hadn’t raised any companints in the last 6 months   
- Reached out from the support team because they were more likely to reply   
- Worked quickly to interview customers and write the case study and get approval from customer   
- As a gesture of thank you sent out cupcakes and greeting to customers  
- Result: published 15+ customer stories in 3 months 

**Rebranding for IPO** 

- Was responsible for rebranding [Freshcaller](https://www.freshworks.com/freshcaller-cloud-pbx/) to Freshdesk Contact Center (Looks like it's been re-re-branded to Freshcaller again) for Freshwork’s IPO  
- Coordinated with multiple teams \- product, marketing, localization and web operations

* Used Google Analytics to prioritize high-traffic web pages and tracked changes across several hundred web pages.   
* Coordinated content updates to reflect the new branding across critical touch points such as ebooks, pitch decks and other external facing collateral.
