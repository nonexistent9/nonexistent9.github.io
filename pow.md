<h2 id="Battlecards"> Building Battlecards from Scratch </h2>

**Problem**  
Freshchat was gearing up for a major re-launch, and we were entering an extremely competitive space with little differentiation between players. I had just moved teams due to a reorg and as a new member of the Freshchat product marketing team, I had \~3 months to prepare battlecards for our top 4–5 competitors, starting from scratch.

**Approach**

* Conducted primary and secondary competitive research to identify key differentiators and positioning strategies.  
* Create battlecard templates with essential compete content for sales and GTM teams.

**Impact**

* Delivered battlecards on time, enabling \~1,000 GTM team members to effectively compete in the market.  
* Supported deals exceeding $100k+ in annual recurring revenue with ad-hoc competitive materials.  
* Solely responsible for Freshchat’s competitive intelligence efforts during this period.

<h2 id="Casestudy"> Customer Case Studies: Partnering with Support to Boost Social Proof </h2>

**Problem**  
We needed compelling customer stories to showcase Freshcaller’s value, but sourcing customer testimonials had been challenging and was not done at scale. 

**Approach**

* Partnered with the support team to identify customers with high satisfaction levels and no complaints in the past 6 months.   
* Reached out through the support team to ensure better response rates.  
* Conducted customer interviews, wrote case studies, and obtained approvals efficiently.  
* Sent personalized thank-you gestures, such as cupcakes and greetings, to strengthen relationships with customers.

**Impact**

* Published 15+ customer stories and collected several testimonials in just 3 months. The campaign has a response rate of more than 50% from customers.

<h2 id="Rebranding"> Rebranding for IPO: Freshcaller to Freshdesk Contact Center </h2>

**Problem**  
As Freshworks prepared for its IPO, Freshcaller needed to be rebranded to align with the broader Freshdesk suite with tight collaboration across marketing, product, and web operations.

**Approach**

* Collaborated with the broader marketing, localization, and web operations teams to ensure a seamless rebranding effort.  
* Used Google Analytics to prioritize high-traffic web pages and tracked changes across several hundred web pages.   
* Coordinated content updates to reflect the new branding across critical touch points such as ebooks, pitch decks and other external facing collateral. 

**Impact**

* Successfully completed the rebranding project, aligning Freshcaller under the Freshdesk brand in time for the IPO.   
* Maintained consistency across digital properties, ensuring minimal disruption for existing customers.
