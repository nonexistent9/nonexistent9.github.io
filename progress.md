<h2> Year of 2025: Work in Progress Updates </h2>

_Inspired by <a href="https://andykong.org/projects/yearofoutput" target="_blank">Year of Output</a>_

**Jan 1-10**  
Freshly graduated, newly unemployed. Lots of uncertainties. I’m focusing on what matters. Been building quite a bit. My commit history is looking good.

Re did my <a href="https://www.varunraghu.com/" target="_blank">personal website</a> and coded up the landing page for my company — <a href="https://triadlabs.co/" target="_blank">Triad Labs</a>.

<a href="https://zeke.so/" target="_blank">Zeke</a> is shaping up well. Product is being built. We hope to launch soon. On that topic, we have set a goal of 100 sign ups by the end of January. There’s been 2-3 I believe till now. Need to understand what is going wrong.

Efforts must be turned towards stuff that moves the needle.

**Jan 12th**

Created Mocks/PRDs for [Zeke](https://zeke.so)

Learning React - Completed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=rO1xglnK3gK6bPjz)

**Jan 16th**

I know I just built [triadlabs.co](https://triadlabs.co) but I already revamped it using Bootstrap. Coding is fun. At least frontend.

Spent most of the day yesterday on my freelance Competitive Intelligence Assignment.

There is no escape I need to speedrun JavaScript before I move to the frameworks.

I should look for ways to increase sign ups for Zeke, to aid with that I wrote two SEO focused pages: 
1. [AI Copilot](https://zeke.so/ai-copilot)
2. [Teal Alternative](https://zeke.so/teal-alternative)

**Jan 18th**

Built another webpage — [Read.cv Alternative](https://zeke.so/portfolio-builder)

Read.cv shutdown, we decided to build an alternative. Will be a good addition to Zeke's tools for job seekers. 

Drove a few signups through my personal LinkedIn posts. That seems to be the only growth strategy that is decently working. 

Couldn't help it, I'm a big fan of OS sites. Created one (using a template of course): [os.varunraghu.com](https://os.varunraghu.com/)
