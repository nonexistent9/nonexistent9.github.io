<h2> Year of 2025: Work in Progress Updates </h2>

_Inspired by <a href="https://andykong.org/projects/yearofoutput" target="_blank">Year of Output</a>_

**Jan 1-10**  
Freshly graduated, newly unemployed. Lots of uncertainties. I’m focusing on what matters. Been building quite a bit. My commit history is looking good.

Re did my <a href="https://www.varunraghu.com/" target="_blank">personal website</a> and coded up the landing page for my company — <a href="https://triadlabs.co/" target="_blank">Triad Labs</a>.

<a href="https://zeke.so/" target="_blank">Zeke</a> is shaping up well. Product is being built. We hope to launch soon. On that topic, we have set a goal of 100 sign ups by the end of January. There’s been 2-3 I believe till now. Need to understand what is going wrong.

Efforts must be turned towards stuff that moves the needle.

**Jan 12th**

Created Mocks/PRDs for [Zeke](https://zeke.so)

Learning React - Completed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=rO1xglnK3gK6bPjz)

**Jan 16th**

I know I just built [triadlabs.co](https://triadlabs.co) but I already revamped it using Bootstrap. Coding is fun. At least frontend.

Spent most of the day yesterday on my freelance Competitive Intelligence Assignment.

There is no escape I need to speedrun JavaScript before I move to the frameworks.

I should look for ways to increase sign ups for Zeke, to aid with that I wrote two SEO focused pages:

1. [AI Copilot](https://zeke.so/ai-copilot)
2. [Teal Alternative](https://zeke.so/teal-alternative)

**Jan 18th**

Built another webpage — [Read.cv Alternative](https://zeke.so/portfolio-builder)

Read.cv shutdown, we decided to build an alternative. Will be a good addition to Zeke's tools for job seekers.

Drove a few signups through my personal LinkedIn posts. That seems to be the only growth strategy that is decently working.

Couldn't help it, I'm a big fan of OS sites. Created one (using a template of course): [os.varunraghu.com](https://os.varunraghu.com/)

**Jan 25th**
We are now getting signups on almost a daily basis. It's only 1-2 on most days but still an achievement.

Set up payment related stuff, have a company bank account now, thinking of going with LemonSqueezy for accepting payments. The setup for that has began.

Gearing up for launch for next week. From then on the goal will be on revenue.

**Jan 27th**

Wasted quite a bit of time exploring alternatives to capcut yesterday. There is literally no other video editing tool on the market that offers same or similar capabilties as Capcut. DaVinci Resolve was so bad. (Well my Laptop couldn't support the requirements.) 

 **Jan 28-31** 

We can now accept payments. All process around that has been set up. 

I ended the month at around 70 signups. Target was 100. Couldn't get there. Need to introspect and come up with a reason why. What worked was me posting from my account on LinkedIn. 

Posted shorts on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@BigTechPhilosopher) It is actually reaching an audience. Had several comments and lot of views on one of my shorts. Clearly people like watching shorter videos better than reading or long form video. e

Product is not out yet. Focus is on launching. Had a few technical hiccups along the way. 

YC released their request for startups, built a landing page for the docusign 2.0 idea here: [docsy](https://docsylp.vercel.app/) 

Applied to a few accelerators and other founder programs, was rejected. Feeling blue and pathless on several days.. 

Need to lock-in harder. Days are long. Months are short. Years are shorter.
