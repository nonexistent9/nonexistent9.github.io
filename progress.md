<h2> Year of 2025: Work in Progress Updates </h2>

*Inspired by <a href="https://andykong.org/projects/yearofoutput" target="_blank">Year of Output</a>* 

**Jan 1-10**  
Freshly graduated, newly unemployed. Lots of uncertainties. I’m focusing on what matters. Been building quite a bit. My commit history is looking good.

Re did my <a href="https://www.varunraghu.com/" target="_blank">personal website</a> and coded up the landing page for my company — <a href="https://triadlabs.co/" target="_blank">Triad Labs</a>. 

<a href="https://zeke.so/" target="_blank">Zeke</a> is shaping up well. Product is being built. We hope to launch soon. On that topic, we have set a goal of 100 sign ups by the end of January. There’s been 2-3 I believe till now. Need to understand what is going wrong. 

Efforts must be turned towards stuff that moves the needle.
