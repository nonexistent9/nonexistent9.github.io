It’s only been a month, 
But my mind has been away for years, 
I couldn’t wish her a proper goodbye, 
There was only angst, 
Of wanting to leave..

I hope you understand, 
I had to leave, 
You had me hostage..

Sometimes I wake up, 
At her shores, 
Anticipating the heavy humidity, 
The warm sea breeze,
The yellow autos, 
Crowded streets, 
The flyovers,
The chaos. 

Everything is different,
I go running and go miles, 
No other soul in sight,  
Everything is clean,
And quiet, 
And eerie,
But the sun, 
It still shines bright..

I hadn’t been away from her in so long, 
It feels like a dream,
Has it really been so long?
