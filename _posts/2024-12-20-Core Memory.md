They say as you get older the days go faster. It's because day after day it's just a repeat. It’s no longer memorable, you don’t have anything new happening. 

As I sat in the silence of my room, it hit me. Silence, after an eventful few days. Top 3-4 days of the year? It's been a grinding year. No time to rest. Just work. I hardly have any friends I hang with. In fact, I can count on one hand the number of “hangouts” I have had. Just lost in my own world. 

But there she came, dropped from the sky – godsend, to rescue me from myself. Yesterday as I was lying in bed, I was thinking how the past week would’ve gone if not for her. Probably unmemorable like most days of the year. 

It’s always very different with childhood friends – I don’t have a lot of those remaining. Lost touch over the years, mostly my fault. Not the best at staying in touch and I enjoy my solitude to a point it's starting to bother me. 
 
Her presence taught me the importance of having company and having people who actually care about you. I felt that after a long time – like someone cared about me outside my immediate family. 

Through ups and downs – forever grateful for her.
