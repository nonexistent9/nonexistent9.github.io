title: "It is time to build"

I usually have a lot of product ideas and things to build. At any given time this image describes my mood:

Despite the constant pangs to build, I never really shipped anything to the outside world. I recently went through [the minimalist entreprenur course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_DfN-mKCGNsj-pn7PtnD-N3Ab4lAtywf&si=jne3kTRm9dvUAka_){:target="_blank"} by Sahil Lavinga (Founder of Gumroad). I was inspired, I had to build and more importantly ship. 

So here it is: [House of Ideas](https://house-of-ideas.super.site){:target="_blank"} hopefully this is the first of many products that I build going into 2024. 

House of Ideas is a place to showcase your product ideas to the world. Personally I know there are many ideas that I have stored away in the notes app on my phone. I wanted to place to showcase those ideas to the world and maybe even build a community that picks up and builds some of these product ideas.
