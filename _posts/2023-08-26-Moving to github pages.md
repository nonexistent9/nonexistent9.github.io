I recently moved my personal website from Wix to Github pages. There was nothing wrong with Wix, but I have always wanted to own my website from end to end. I wanted complete customizability without having to pay a monthly charge.

I have tried to set up Github Pages and Jekyll earlier but always ran into some problem or the other and opted for the easier website builder solutions like Wix. This time I was determined to make it work. After a few tutorials on YouTube, I got the website up and running. I had a domain purchased earlier so I just pointed my Github page to the custom domain - varunraghu.com. 

It was a great learning experience, I learnt Github pages, Jekyll and Git all through this small project. It took about 2 days, but the results are fully worth it as I'd be saving a couple of hundred dollars every year.
